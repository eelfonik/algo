N.B. The big O notation always talks about the worst-case scenario, but more practically we'll think about average-case scenario.

We have 5 common big O runtime

- O(log<sub>n</sub>), also known as *log time.* Example: Binary search.
- O(*n*), also known as *linear time*. Example: Simple search.
- O(*n* * log<sub>n</sub>). Example: A fast sorting algorithm, like quicksort.
- O(*n*<sup>2</sup>). Example: A slow sorting algorithm, like selection sort.
- O(*n*!). Example: A really slow algorithm, like the traveling salesperson.
